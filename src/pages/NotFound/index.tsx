                <p>
                    Oops! It looks like the page you are trying to access doesn't exist.
                    Maybe it took a vacation, decided to explore the universe, or got
                    lost somewhere between two black holes. 🌌
                </p>
                <p>
                    Don't worry, you're not lost in space (yet). You can safely go back
                    to the <a href='/'>home page</a> or{' '}
                    <a href='/history'>to your history</a> — or you can stay here and
                    pretend you found a secret page that only the coolest explorers can
                    access. 🧭✨
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you think this page should exist (or if you want to chat about time
                    travel and wormholes), feel free to reach out. Otherwise, use the menu
                    to head back to the real world.
                </p>

                    In the meantime, here's a thought: "If a page doesn't exist on the
                    internet, did it ever really exist at all?" 🤔💭
